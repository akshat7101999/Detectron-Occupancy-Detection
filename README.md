# Detectron-Occupancy-Detection
How many times it has happened that you visit a restaurant or a food plaza and it is completely full with no occupancy left. It would have been better if you could know about the occupancy of a restaurant/plaza before hand through a display (online/offline). Now a days it is done by placing sensors and then knowing which tables are occupied. But there is an issue with the sensors that they require batteries to operate thus increasing the cost. Also sesnors can get faulty with time thus giving false readings with time, forcing the owner to change them.  We provide a solution by applying deep learning on the cctv footage and then applying some logic to know the occupancy of each table thus live updating the display.   Now this will also help the owner to know the statistics of the plaza i.e. on which day did maximum people came, how opening the plaza on sunday affected the people coming and all other stats.  This solution can also be used for energy saving purposes i.e. lights will be switched off if no person is there in the hall and only when someone comes lights will get switched on.
